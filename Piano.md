## Designing Piano Keys 

Piano keys will be displayed in front of the player. I haven't decided yet whether they will be moving towards the player or the player will be moving towards the piano keys. For now I have got a nice smooth movement from right to left and left right and player is cube is moving forward. Unfortunatly I can't make a piano directly in unity because the cubes would be overlapping each other. I can't cut out shapes from cubes in Unity so I need to use photoshop or some other similar software which allows me to draw shapes. Each shape needs to represent one key on the piano so in total I will have to have 13 keys (C ---> C ). All the keys must be separately created as well as black keys. This will allow for more control that I will have in the code later on, because I will most likely have something like: If the cube (that is our letter that corresponds to one of the keys on the piano) hits the key (so our cut out cube) then add or take away a  point from the player. 

I need to know the size of the grid in Unity so that I can appropiately draw the shapes in photoshop.
